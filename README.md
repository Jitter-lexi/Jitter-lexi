### Hi, I'm Alexis :rabbit2:
:100: I am currently studying at Arizona State University for Graphic Information Technology.

:white_flower: At the moment I am learning about the universe of coding, and although it is very challenging, I am having a lot of fun and cannot wait to implement what I have learned into future projects.

:hearts:My hobbies include video editing, reading, illustrating, photography, and binging shows with my husband.
